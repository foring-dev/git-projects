            <dt>How to become a Coder</dt>
            <dd>Whether they go by the title coder, developer, software engineer, hacker, or programmer, those who can help create computer programs, apps, sites or systems are in hot demand — and you can earn a high salary writing code without a formal education.

                Bloomberg calls the software development job market “the highest demand market in 20 years,” with the unemployment rate in this sector at half of the unemployment rate overall.
                
                The newswire writes:
                
                    “While companies are writing bigger checks, they are also adopting new strategies to find engineers for an economy where software is penetrating even mundane processes. Companies are focusing more on training, sourcing new talent through apprenticeships, and looking at atypical pools of candidates who have transferable skills.”
                
                As every single vertical of our professional and personal lives is moving online — to phone apps and functions, voice-activated artificial intelligence like Alexa and Google Voice, manufacturing and retail systems — anything involving a screen and digital communication. </dd>
